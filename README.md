# IMS Project

The purpose of this project was to use Git/source control, Java, SQL and SDET to create a fully functional database management system that has CRUD functions for customers, items and orders. I used Java as the programming language, Git and Jira boards as my source controls, Java as the programming language, SQL to create and manage the database, and SDET to test the code and methods. However, due to some technical difficulities and time constraints, I was able to only get some of the classes created for "Items" and a JIRA board. [If interested, here is a link to my JIRA board] (https://corry-coder.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/IMS/boards/1)

## Getting Started

There are two ways to get my project on your local machine. The first way is to cloe my repo. You can do this by copying my repo link. After that, create a GitHub folder on your desktop. Inside that folder open Git Bash and enter git clone followed by my repo link. The second way to get my project up and running on your machine is to import the project onto your IDE directly from GitHub. Firstly, you should copy my repo link. Then, inside your eclipse IDE, go to file>import>Git>Projects from Git smart import. Then click on Clone URI. My details should atuomatically fill due to the copied repo link. Fill in your credentials and hit finish..

### Prerequisites

- Git Bash
- Jira
- MySQL Workbench
- Maven
- Eclipse IDE

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system. Break down into which tests and what they do

### Unit Tests 

Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Give an example
```

### Integration Tests 
Explain what these tests test, why and how to run them

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example

## Acknowledgments

* I would like to thank Harry for allowing me to use his starter template. It was a big help and a great jumping off point for the project. I couldn't imagine starting this project off from scratch. The readme teamplate layout is also awesome. It's been awhile since I've done basic formatting and syntax witing for GitHub and was an excellent refresher.
